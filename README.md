A Talk on why CSS Houdini is dead, but `@property` is not.

> Christian Schaefer (https://twitter.com/derSchepp), known as "Schepp", is a freelance frontend developer from DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. Instead of hacking around with JS-Frameworks as almost every other frontend developer currently does, he works on traditional server-rendered component-based systems, uses bleeding edge CSS, has an eye on accessibility as well as the loading and runtime performance of a site. And then he also organizes a meetup (https://www.meetup.com/Webworker-NRW/) and co-hosts a podcast (https://workingdraft.de/).
